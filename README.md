# RISC-V-Handwritten-Number-Reader
<p>This is a machine learning algorithm, with parts of the matrix operations written in RISC V Assembly code</p>

<p> This machine learning algorithm recognizes hand-written numbers and outputs the digital number the image represents. Since it uses several machine 
learning operations, these operations are implemented in assembly to improve efficiency while also giving me the opportunity to understand how to write 
instructions on a much more lower level. Parts of the assignment were written by my CMPT 295 (Introduction to Computer Systems) professor, 
Arrvindh Shriraman. <p/>
